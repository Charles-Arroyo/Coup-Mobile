# SpringBoot JPA: One to One relation example
### One to One relations
In object-oriented programming, real-life entities are represented as classes, and in MySQL, they are stored as tables. JPA/Hibernate is a framework that matches a Class to Table(
each variable represents a column) to ease the manipulation of data in Java. Entities almost always interact with one another and establish individual relationships among 
themselves Eg: A Person will have exactly one social security number(One to One), A person can have multiple cars(One to Many), etc. This example is created with the assumption
that one person can have only one laptop(made by poor people). It shows how a one to one relation can be represented between entities using JPA/Hibernate.
